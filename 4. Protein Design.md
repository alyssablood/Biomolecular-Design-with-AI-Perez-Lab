## RFdiffusion and ProteinMPNN
**ProteinMPNN**: Optimizes amino acid sequences for most stable protein backbones. Good for designing new target proteins.
ProteinMPNN stands for Protein Protein Message Passing Neural Network, which is a deep-learning method for *inverse* protein folding. It recieves a 3D structure and predicts the amino acid sequence that makes up the protein backbone. This method is great for when you need a protein with a specific structure to accomplish a desired function, and want to know what sequence the desired protein would likely have.

**RFDiffusion**: Generates new protein backbones using diffusion models. Adds in noise to allow for flexibility in folding. Results MUST be checked carefully. It is very easy to add too much noise and generate garbage outputs.
## BindCraft and other emerging methods
**BindCraft**: Good for desiging a new binder custom fit to a target protein. It is generally very accurate, but follows strict garbage in garbage out policy. Input protein must be high accuracy, and runs take a relatively long time. link iGEM
