## RFdiffusion and ProteinMPNN
ProteinMPNN: Optimizes amino acid sequences for most stable protein backbones. Good for designing new target proteins.

RFDiffusion: Generates new protein backbones using diffusion models. Adds in noise to allow for flexibility in folding. Results MUST be checked carefully. It is very easy to add too much noise and generate garbage outputs.
## BindCraft and other emerging methods
BindCraft: Good for desiging a new binder custom fit to a target protein. It is generally very accurate, but follows strict garbage in garbage out policy. Input protein must be high accuracy, and runs take a relatively long time. link iGEM
