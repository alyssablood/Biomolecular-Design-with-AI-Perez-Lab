# 1. Introduction & Background
## AI and structures: from games to molecules
The single most important concept to rmember when dealing with proteins is:

**STRUCTURE = FUNCTION**

Most of what we deal with in Biomolecular Design is protein structures. Whether we're dealing with enzymes, drugs, receptors, or any other protein--we're usually on a mission to understand the structure of our target molecule. The reason for this is that once we understand a structure, we can either predict its resulting function or modify the structure to achieve a desired function.
