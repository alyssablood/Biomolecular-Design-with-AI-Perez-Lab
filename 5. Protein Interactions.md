## AlphaFold competitive binding assays (AF-CBA)
**AlphaFold2**: Extremely popular tool for deriving a 3D structure from an amino acid sequence. Very high accuracy, industry standard. [Here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01381-z) is a useful paper outlining the functionality of AlphaFold2, along with some information on user usage.

**AlphaFold3**: Expansion of AlphaFold2 that also analyzes interacions between molecules. Program won 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. [Here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w) is another paper introducing AlphaFold3.
