## Visualization
  - **Chimera**: Best for generating final graphics for presentations, models alpha helix versus beta pleats.
  - **VMD**: Best for modeling multiple docking poses and animating mechamisms. Many options for color/shape of models.

## Docking Poses (not mechanism)
  - **AMBER**: Uses physics-based (p-chem) methods to apply force fields (vector equations) to molecules in order to predict folding, docking, and general behavior. Good for very specific results, binding energy and other outputs are considered reliable.
  - **AutoDock**: Predicts how ligand and protein interact, and what binding conformation would occur. P-chem methods are NOT used, therefore specific numbers are considered unreliable. Good for preliminary testing to get shape and quantity of docked poses.

## Protein Design
  - **BindCraft**: Good for desiging a new binder custom fit to a target protein. It is generally very accurate, but follows strict garbage in garbage out policy. Input protein must be high accuracy, and runs take a relatively long time. link iGEM
  - **ProteinMPNN**: Optimizes amino acid sequences for most stable protein backbones. Good for designing new target proteins.
  - **RFDiffusion**: Generates new protein backbones using diffusion models. Adds in noise to allow for flexibility in folding. Results MUST be checked carefully. It is very easy to add too much noise and generate garbage outputs.

## Protein Folding
  - **AlphaFold2**: Extremely popular tool for deriving a 3D structure from an amino acid sequence. Very high accuracy, industry standard. link baker paper
  - **AlphaFold3**: Expansion of AlphaFold2 that also analyzes interacions between molecules. Program won 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. link baker paper
