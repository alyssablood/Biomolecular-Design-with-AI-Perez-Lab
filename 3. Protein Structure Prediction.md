# 3. Protein Structure Prediction

## [Protein Folding](https://github.com/alyssablood/Perez-Lab-Intro-Tutorials/blob/main/5.%20Protein%20Interactions.md#alphafold-competitive-binding-assays-af-cba)
  - [**AlphaFold2**](https://github.com/alyssablood/Perez-Lab-Intro-Tutorials/blob/main/5.%20Protein%20Interactions.md#alphafold-competitive-binding-assays-af-cba): Extremely popular tool for deriving a 3D structure from an amino acid sequence. Very high accuracy, industry standard. You can read the AlphaFold official paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2).
  - [**AlphaFold3**](https://github.com/alyssablood/Perez-Lab-Intro-Tutorials/blob/main/5.%20Protein%20Interactions.md#alphafold-competitive-binding-assays-af-cba): Expansion of AlphaFold2 that also analyzes interacions between molecules. This program won 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. You can read the AlphaFold3 official paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w).
  - [**AMBER**](https://github.com/alyssablood/Perez-Lab-Intro-Tutorials/blob/main/6.%20Protein%20Dynamics.md#beyond-static-folds-ensembles-and-motion): Uses physics-based (p-chem) methods to apply [force fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_field_(chemistry)) (vector equations) to molecules in order to predict folding, docking, and general behavior. Good for very specific results, binding energy and other outputs are considered reliable. AMBER's homepage and tutorials are linked [here](https://ambermd.org/index.php).
### Docking
  - Docking programs can be very similar to protein dynamics, however they are not capable of predicting mechanisms as they do not consider time-dependant factors. They are used primarily to predict final docked conformations.
  - [**AutoDock**](https://github.com/alyssablood/Perez-Lab-Intro-Tutorials/blob/main/5.%20Protein%20Interactions.md#docking-methods): Predicts how ligand and protein interact, and what binding conformation would occur. P-chem methods are NOT used, therefore specific numbers are considered unreliable. Good for preliminary testing to get shape and quantity of docked poses. An overview of the AutoDock suite's capabilities can be found [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4868550/).

## [Protein Design](https://github.com/alyssablood/Perez-Lab-Intro-Tutorials/blob/main/4.%20Protein%20Design.md#4-protein-design)
  - [**BindCraft**](https://github.com/alyssablood/Perez-Lab-Intro-Tutorials/blob/main/4.%20Protein%20Design.md#bindcraft-and-other-emerging-methods): Good for desiging a new binder custom fit to a target protein. It is generally very accurate, but follows strict garbage in garbage out policy. Input protein must be high accuracy, and runs take a relatively long time. You can read the BindCraft official paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09429-6).

  - [**ProteinMPNN**](https://github.com/alyssablood/Perez-Lab-Intro-Tutorials/blob/main/4.%20Protein%20Design.md#rfdiffusion-and-proteinmpnn): Optimizes amino acid sequences for most stable protein backbones. Good for designing new target proteins. You can read a paper introducing ProteinMPNN [here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add2187).
  - [**RFDiffusion**](https://github.com/alyssablood/Perez-Lab-Intro-Tutorials/blob/main/4.%20Protein%20Design.md#rfdiffusion-and-proteinmpnn): Generates new protein backbones using diffusion models. Adds in noise to allow for flexibility in folding. Results MUST be checked carefully. It is very easy to add too much noise and generate garbage outputs. You can read RFDiffusion's official paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06415-8).

    Note: the RF in RFDiffusion stands for RoseTTAFold, which you can read more on [here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8754).



## Visualization
  - **Chimera**: Best for generating final graphics for presentations, models alpha helix versus beta pleats. Chimera tutorials can be found [here](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/tutorials.html).
  - **VMD**: Best for modeling multiple docking poses and animating mechamisms. Many options for color/shape of models. VMD tutorials can be found [here](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/vmd/tutorial-html/).
