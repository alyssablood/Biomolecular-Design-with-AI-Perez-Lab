# 2. Visualization of Protein Structures

To actually visualize the PDB files, we must open them in one of these programs:

## Protein Visualition Programs
- [VMD](https://github.com/alyssablood/Biomolecular-Design-with-AI-Perez-Lab/blob/main/2.%20Visualization%20of%20Protein%20Structures.md#vmd)
- [ChimeraX](https://github.com/alyssablood/Biomolecular-Design-with-AI-Perez-Lab/blob/main/2.%20Visualization%20of%20Protein%20Structures.md#chimerax)

### ChimeraX Tutorial

[ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/) is another visualization program that is more user-friendly than VMD. 

Go to [this page](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/download.html) to download ChimeraX and follow the installiation instructions based on your system (Windows, Mac, etc). Once fully installed, open it up.

To open a PDB file that was downloaded onto your computer from the PDB, click on -
>File → Open → PDB_file

This will load the model and bring you to a screen that looks like this (may vary depending on the version and device operating system) -
