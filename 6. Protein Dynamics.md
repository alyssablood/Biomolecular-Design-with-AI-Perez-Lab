# 6. Protein Dynamics
## Beyond static folds: ensembles and motion
AMBER is a [Molecular Dynamics (MD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) software widely used to model molecular movement and behavior under given conditions. [Here](https://ambermd.org/2012_wires.pdf) is a PDF introducing AMBER and how to use it.

[VMD](https://github.com/alyssablood/Perez-Lab-Intro-Tutorials/blob/main/3.%20Protein%20Structure%20Prediction.md#visualization) is a great tool to visualize protein dynamics after running AMBER or similar programs, as it allows you to animate the optput to see a (very slowed down) visual representation of molecular behavior.
