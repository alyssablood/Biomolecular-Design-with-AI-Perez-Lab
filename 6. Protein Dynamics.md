# 6. Protein Dynamics
## Beyond static folds: ensembles and motion
AMBER is a Molecular Dynamics (MD) [Here](https://ambermd.org/2012_wires.pdf) is a PDF introducing what AMBER is, and how to use it.

[VMD](https://github.com/alyssablood/Perez-Lab-Intro-Tutorials/blob/main/3.%20Protein%20Structure%20Prediction.md#visualization) is a great tool to visualize protein dynamics after running AMBER or similar programs.
