# 6. Protein Dynamics
## Beyond static folds: ensembles and motion
AMBER is a [Molecular Dynamics (MD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) software widely used to model molecular movement and behavior under given conditions. [Here](https://ambermd.org/2012_wires.pdf) is a PDF introducing AMBER and how to use it. The [AMBER Homepage](https://ambermd.org/index.php) does a great job of explaining download and installation procedures, along with providing tutorials to get you started.

Now take a look at the [AMBER tutorials page](https://ambermd.org/tutorials/):

You should NOT complete every AMBER tutorial immediately, as they contain far more information than you'll need. Try to identify WHY you're using AMBER  first, then either research independently or speak to a mentor about which AMBER functionalities would actually benefit your project.

>$ EX: If the free energy of a system is of particular interst to you, you will likely focus on tutorial sections 1 (Building Systems), 3 (Creating Stable Systems and Running MD), and 7 (Free Energies). 

[VMD](https://github.com/alyssablood/Perez-Lab-Intro-Tutorials/blob/main/3.%20Protein%20Structure%20Prediction.md#visualization) is a great tool to visualize protein dynamics after running AMBER or similar programs, as it allows you to animate the optput to see a (very slowed down) visual representation of molecular behavior.
