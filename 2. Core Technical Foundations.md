### Common terminal commands you'll need (try to memorize these):
- **cd = change directory**
  >$ cd /orange/professor_name/your_name/folder1

  This command is used to navigate into/out of folders from the command line.

  Note: **$ cd ../** will go backwards a directory.

  So if you're in folder1 above, and type **cd ../../** then you will be in professor_name folder.


- **ls = list**
  >$ ls

  This feature will print a list of all files and folders stored at the location you are currently in.

  Note: **$ ls -l** will also print advanced data such as file size and ownership.

- **mkdir = make directory**
  >$ mkdir directory_name

  In terminal, a directory is what you would normally call a folder. This is a new location to store your files.

- **rm = remove**
  >$ rm -rf directory_name

  This command deletes (or removes) the specified directory. The **-rf** addition is important in order to give it permission to also delete folders that are _not_ empty.

- **mv = move**
  >$ mv path/to/starting/location path/to/ending/location

  This command moves files from one location to another.

- **cp = copy**
  >$ cp path/to/starting/location path/to/ending/location

  This works the same as **mv**, but it does not modify the original file.

- **vi = visual**
  >$ vi file_name

  This command is used to open (or visualize) a file. 

  Note: once the file is open you must either **:q** = quit, **:q!** = quit without saving, or **:wq** = write and quit (save changes).
- **git clone = clones github repository**
  >$ git clone repository_url

  This command duplicates a github repository at the given url to your current location.
