### Common terminal commands you'll need (try to memorize these):
**cd = change directory**
>$ cd /orange/professor_name/your_name/folder1

This command is used to navigate into/out of folders from the command line.

Note: **$ cd ../** will go backwards a directory.

So if you're in folder1 above, and type **cd ../../** then you will be in professor_name folder.


**ls = list**
>$ ls

This feature will print a list of all files and folders stored at the location you are currently in.

Note: **$ ls -l** will also print advanced data such as file size and ownership.

**mkdir = make directory**
>$ mkdir directory_name

In terminal, a directory is what you would normally call a folder. This is a new location to store your files.

**rm = remove**
>$ rm -rf directory_name

This command deletes (or removes) the specified directory. The **-rf** addition is important in order to give it permission to also delete folders that are _not_ empty.

**mv = move**
>$ mv path/to/starting/location path/to/ending/location

This command moves files from one location to another.

**cp = copy**
>$ cp path/to/starting/location path/to/ending/location

This works the same as **mv**, but it does not modify the original file.

**vi = visual**
>$ vi file_name

This command is used to open (or visualize) a file. 

Note: once the file is open you must either **:q** = quit, **:q!** = quit without saving, or **:wq** = write and quit (save changes).
